## Demo Script

## How can I use this repo?

1. You can do this locally
   - Clone this project locally: 
   - git clone https://github.com/forcedotcom/WorkDotCom-Partners.git
     - Run orgInit.sh file: Check https://github.com/forcedotcom/WorkDotCom-Partners/blob/master/orgInit.sh for commands
     - ./orgInit.sh
2. You can use this via Heroku Deployer because this repo is ADK ready: https://github.com/sfdcteteam/ADKTemplate

## Are there any steps after org is created?
These scripts do NOT configure Work.com and Command Center in its entirety. You need to go through the documentation and setup your org for Work.com. The automation script (orgInit.sh) only does steps which can be done automatically.

In addition, there are some permission sets which are generated by Apex. While we run the Apex code in orgInit.sh, it may take some time to create those permission sets. That means permission set assignment may or may not work in orgInit.sh after we run demo-setup.apex. In that, please ensure to assign following permission sets to the admin user manually:

- Workplace_Admin_Access_Group
- Workplace_Command_Center_Access
- Workplace_Admin_Objects

## Does this repo contain test data?
Yes. There are test data scripts for work.com data model objects. You can manually load this data as per https://github.com/forcedotcom/WorkDotCom-Partners/blob/master/dx-utils/load_test_data.sh. Please note that test data will be automatically loaded if you run ./orgInit.sh

## How can view Command Center?
Once your org is ready, you can open "Command Center" app to view default dashboard.

## Will Command Center be completely configured?
No. This repo provides minimum setup needed to view Command Center dashboard (managed package installation, permission set assignment and test data).

If you want to view other components (like Employee Wellness, Surveys, Community for Surveys etc) then you need to go through Command Center Setup guide. One reason is because many steps are not available via metadata and SFDX. For example, Survey and Community link, default page layout assignments etc

Please note extra permissionsets in force-app/main/default/permissionsets
  - Most of those are the same permission from setup guide so you can skip those steps and get right into configuration
  - Let us know if any permission is missing
  - Do not use these in an active org with real user data without reviewing all the permissions


## Are there any sample apps that can help me build an app for work.com?
Appiphony, a PDO, has built an app that you can use to check for code samples. https://github.com/appiphony/building-management-app

We have created custom version of "Command Center" App's Home page and pre-added Appiphony components. You can use above repo to look at the source.

## Can ISVs check what features they may have used in their packages?

Yes, you can check that using ISV TE DX Plugin. ISV TE DX plugin has been updated to look for work.com object usage when you add custom fields on those objects. You will be able to see if your package has added any work.com data model dependencies.

To Install or update the plugin: sfdx plugins:install isvte-sfdx-plugin

When executed against a package with depends on Work.com you will see output similar to:

Feature and License Dependencies:

  Work.com

More information about this plugin can be found at https://medium.com/inside-the-salesforce-ecosystem/build-better-apps-for-your-customers-with-this-new-dx-plug-in-4877fa0fc305


## How can I manually use Test Data Scripts
Sometimes you may want to load test data in existing org. You can run these data scripts using dx-utils/load_test_data.sh.

You will need "testdata" and "dx-utils/apex-scripts" directories and run following commands.

sfdx force:data:tree:import -p ./testdata/InternalOrganizationUnit-Employee-EmployeeCrisisAssessment-plan.json

sfdx force:apex:execute -f ./dx-utils/apex-scripts/updateLocationVisitorAddressId.apex


Please note that we only have Test Data for following objects.

Test data is for following objects
- Location (Core)
- Employee (Core)
- EmployeeCrisisAssessment (Core)
- Internal Organization Unit (Core)


Note:
- We have temporarily removed Appiphony sample app while we are working on fixing some issues
- We have removed extra permissions sets as those are not applicable with latest version of app
-- Please check documentation on the process which generates permission sets after running some Apex and need to be assigned to users
